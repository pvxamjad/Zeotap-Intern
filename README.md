# Zeotap-Intern


Dear HR,

I am new to data science and still working as a web developer, but I am looking to transition into the data science field. While I am experienced in web development, I realized that my strengths lie more in back-end development, and I wanted to explore the exciting opportunities in data science. During this process, I did seek help from ChatGPT for some coding and clarifications.

I hope this project showcases my progress, and I would appreciate your response, whether it's yes or no.

Thank you!
